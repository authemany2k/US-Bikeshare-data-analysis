How to Complete and Submit this Project You have two options for working on and submitting your project:

Option #1) On the next page, "Project Workspace: Complete and Submit Project," you will see that there is a workspace environment set up where you can do all your work on your Python script, and run it with the terminal provided. This is great if you do not want to work on your local machine, or worry about system requirements.

Clicking "Open File" allows you to open any .py file in the workspace. Clicking on "Open Terminal" will bring up a terminal interface similar to the one on your local machine. You can then execute a Python script from your workspace, like bikeshare.py, in this terminal in the same way that you would on your machine, by typing after the prompt "python bikeshare.py".

The environment will continually save your work.

If you choose this option #1, then you should also submit your project right from this workspace. You won't upload any files for your submission with this option, because the .py file in the workspace will be uploaded by default.

Option #2) You can work on your Python script on your local machine. To do this, you should download the necessary project files from the Resources tab (the folder icon in the left sidebar here).

If you choose this option #2, please submit your project using the button on the last page of this lesson, "Project: Explore US Bikeshare Data," where you will be able to upload your project files.

You should choose one of these two options above - don't try to submit your project in both places.

With either option, before you submit, make sure your project meets all the necessary elements of the Project Rubric.
