# Explore-US-BikeShare-Data

## Overview
This project is part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree and is used to explore data related to bike share systems for Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It imports data from csv files and compute descriptive statistics from the data. It also takes in users' raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## The Datasets
The datasets provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider in the US, contains randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. The data files for all three cities contain the same core six columns:

Start Time
End Time
Trip Duration
Start Station
End Station
User Type

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

Gender
Birth Year
